# Kyria keymap

This is a customized ZMK config for Kyria keyboard with a machine readable layout and keymap definitions to use with [keymap-editor] tool.

This is a work in progress so there is unfinished base layer and almost empty second layer.
If you would like to work on it please clone it and authorize the editor to access it.

## notes about my setup
I'm using kyria with two nice!nano microcontrollers flashed with ZMK firmware. I've decided to use standard QWERTY layout for now. As for the extra keys - I'm starting with default kyria layout but there will be a lot of changes later on. Right now there is a lot of repetition there and I don't like the placement of some of the keys.

There are few guiding principles:
- base layer is mostly for standard typing
- sometimes I type in polish so I need easy access to LALT
- my WM of choice is I3 so I need to have access to META key, sometimes with strange combinations (META + SHIFT + <number>)
- I will be switching layers with left and right pinkie
- second layer - for now it's mostly for digits but later
- to be continued ...
